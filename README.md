## IPFS Deployment Guide

To properly deploy the application to IPFS:

1. Run the build-for-ipfs.sh script to create the optimized build:
   ```
   ./build-for-ipfs.sh
   ```

2. Once the build completes, you'll have a directory called `ipfs-build/` in the project root.

3. **IMPORTANT**: Only upload the *contents* of the `ipfs-build/` directory to IPFS, not the entire project.

   This ensures that:
   - The `index.html` file is at the root level
   - Only production assets are included (not source code, configuration files, etc.)
   - The IPFS gateway will display your website correctly instead of a directory listing

4. If you're using Fleek, Pinata, or another IPFS pinning service, point it to the `ipfs-build/` directory.

Common IPFS Deployment Issues:
- If you see a directory listing when accessing your IPFS hash, you've likely uploaded the entire project instead of just the build output
- Make sure the upload includes the `index.html` file at the root level
- The total size should be much smaller than the entire project (typically <100MB vs several GB)
